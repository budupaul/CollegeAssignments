  <h1>CSS2 vs. CSS3</h1>


  <p>CSS3 is the latest standard for CSS. CSS3 is completely backwards-compatible with earlier versions of CSS.</p>


  <p>Some of the most new features in CSS3:</p>


  <ul>
    <li><b>Rounded Borders</b><br>
    CSS3 has introduced <i>border-radius</i> property. Using that an element can have rounded border.</li>


    <li><b>Multiple background images</b><br>
    Using background-image, background-repeat, and background-position property styles programmer can specify multiple background images layered for a selector on top of one another in the box.</li>


    <li><b>2D and 3D transformations</b><br>
    CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements. A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position. CSS3 supports 2D and 3D transformations.</li>


    <li><b>Gradients</b><br>
    CSS3 gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. Earlier, you had to use images for these effects. However, by using CSS3 gradients you can reduce download time and bandwidth usage. In addition, elements with gradients look better when zoomed, because the gradient is generated by the browser.</li>


    <li><b>Shadows</b><br>
    With CSS3 you can add shadow to text and to elements.</li>
  </ul>
